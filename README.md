Richkit is a python3 package that provides tools taking 
a domain name as input, and returns addtional information
on that domain. It can be an analysis of the domain itself, looked up
from data-bases, retrieved from other services, or some combination
thereof.

The purpose of richkit is to provide a reusable library of domain
name-related analysis, lookups, and retrieval functions, that are
shared within the Network Security research group at Aalborg
University, and also availble to the public for reuse and modification.

# Requirements

The only requirement in order to run richkit is `python` 3.5+

# Installation

In order to install richikit just type in the terminal `pip install richkit`

# Usage

The following codes can be used to retrieve the TLD and the URL category, respectively.

```python3
from richkit.analyse import tld

urls = ["www.aau.dk","www.github.com","www.google.com"]

for url in urls:
   print(tld(url))
```

```python3
from richkit.retrieve.symantec import fetch_from_internet
from richkit.retrieve.symantec import LocalCategoryDB

urls = ["www.aau.dk","www.github.com","www.google.com"]

local_db = LocalCategoryDB()
for url in urls:
   url_category=local_db.get_category(url)
   if url_category=='':
      url_category=fetch_from_internet(url)
   print(url_category)
```

# Modules

Richkit define a set of functions categorized by the following modules:
- `richkit.analyse`: This module provides functions that can be applied to a domain
name. Similarly to `richkit.lookup`, and in contrast to `richkit.retrieve`,
this is done without disclosing the domain name to third parties and
breaching confidentiality.
- `richkit.lookup`: This modules provides the ability to look up domain names in local
resources, i.e. the domain name cannot be sent of to third
parties. The module might fetch resources, such as lists or
databasese, but this must be done in a way that keeps the domain name
confidential. Contrast this with `richkit.retrieve`.
- `richkit.retrieve`: This module provides the ability to retrieve data on domain names of
any sort. It comes without the "confidentiality contract" of
`richkit.lookup`.
